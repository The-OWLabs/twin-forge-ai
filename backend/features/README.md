# Feature Domain Modules (`backend/features`)

This directory houses the **7 core manufacturing intelligence domains** of TwinForge.

Every feature module is developed as an independent, self-contained domain following **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.

---

## Standardized Hexagonal Module Structure

To ensure consistency, maintainability, and loose coupling, every feature follows an identical subfolder layout:

```
<feature_name>/
├── README.md        # Feature specification, domain model, and integration contracts
├── domain/          # Pure business logic: Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events, Invariants
│                    # (ZERO framework dependencies; no database, no HTTP, no ML library imports)
├── ports/           # Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) / Protocols defining contracts:
│   ├── input/       # Driving ports: Use-case interfaces consumed by APIs, MCP, and CLI
│   └── output/      # Driven ports: Repository contracts, sensor readers, ML inference interfaces
├── services/        # Application services orchestrating domain logic and calling output ports
├── adapters/        # Concrete implementations of driven ports:
│   ├── persistence/ # SQL / NoSQL / Time-Series repository implementations
│   ├── ml/          # Machine learning model inference (ONNX, PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenCV)
│   └── external/    # Third-party APIs and external service clients
└── api/             # Driving adapters: FastAPI route controllers, request/response DTOs, schemas
```
