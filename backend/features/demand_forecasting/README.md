# Manufacturing Demand Forecasting & Intelligent Operations Platform

An enterprise-grade, constraint-aware manufacturing demand forecasting and operational planning platform built on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and deployed with **FastAPI**, **BigQuery**, **Vertex AI / BigQuery ML**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Capabilities

The **Manufacturing Demand Forecasting Platform** connects demand sensing with shop-floor operational realities. Rather than generating unconstrained time-series forecasts in a silo, the platform unifies:
1. **Machine Learning Demand Forecasting**: Multi-horizon probabilistic forecasting ($P_{10}, P_{50}, P_{90}$) evaluating Gradient Boosted Trees (GBDT) and Exponential Smoothing against a strict Seasonal-Naive ($s=7$) baseline using out-of-time chronological validation.
2. **Constraint-Aware Production Planning**: Translates forecast demand into feasible shop-floor work orders governed by machine cycle times, line capacity ceilings, raw material availability, scrap rate allowances, and scheduled maintenance blackout windows.
3. **Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization**: Tracks stock positions across Raw Materials, WIP, Finished Goods, and MRO Spares; computes Days of Inventory (DOI) and generates dynamic Reorder Point (ROP) replenishment recommendations.
4. **Maintenance & Equipment Reliability**: Monitors asset operational status, historical MTBF and MTTR, and calculates capacity-at-risk from planned maintenance windows.
5. **Quality Engineering Analytics**: Connects First-Pass Yield (FPY), DPMO, and scrap rates directly into production planning to ensure net output meets customer delivery commitments.
6. **What-If Scenario Simulation Engine**: Simulates demand shocks (+25% surge), supply chain lead-time expansions, equipment breakdowns, and scrap spikes with strict data provenance auditing (`SIMULATED` vs `ACTUAL`).
7. **Enterprise Ingestion Pipeline**: Ingests, schema-validates, deduplicates, and quarantines batch extracts from ERP (SAP S/4HANA), MES, and SCADA systems.

## 2. Mathematical Formulations & Planning Logic

### A. Net Requirements Calculation
Production planning computes net requirements for each product $i$ over horizon $H$:
$$\text{Net requirements}_i = \max(0, \text{forecast demand}_i + \text{safety stock}_i - \text{usable inventory}_i - \text{confirmed supply}_i)$$

To account for scrap generated during manufacturing, the planned production volume is adjusted by the historical First Pass Yield (FPY) or scrap rate:
$$\text{Planned production}_i = \frac{\text{Net requirements}_i}{1 - \text{scrap rate}_i}$$

### B. Machine Capacity & Downtime Deduction
For production line $L$ over horizon $H$:
$$\text{Effective machine capacity}_L = (\text{daily capacity hours}_L \times H) - \text{scheduled maintenance downtime hours}_L$$

Feasible production is constrained by line hours and raw material availability:
$$\text{Max units by capacity}_L = \frac{\text{Effective machine capacity}_L \times \text{usable yield rate}_i}{\text{cycle time per unit}_i}$$
$$\text{Feasible production}_i = \min(\text{Planned production}_i, \text{Max units by capacity}_L, \text{Material limit}_i)$$
$$\text{Unmet demand}_i = \max(0, \text{Net requirements}_i - \text{Feasible production}_i)$$

### C. Out-of-Time Chronological Validation Metrics
To guarantee zero future data leakage, models are evaluated on out-of-time chronological holdout windows:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
  $$\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n |y_t - \hat{y}_t|$$
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
  $$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n (y_t - \hat{y}_t)^2}$$
- **Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE)**:
  $$\text{WAPE} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^n |y_t - \hat{y}_t|}{\sum_{t=1}^n y_t}$$
- **Forecast Bias**:
  $$\text{Bias} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^n (\hat{y}_t - y_t)}{\sum_{t=1}^n y_t}$$
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**:
  $$\text{MAPE} = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n \left| \frac{y_t - \hat{y}_t}{y_t} \right| \quad (\text{for } y_t > 0)$$

### D. Inventory Health & Replenishment
$$\text{Days of Inventory (DOI)} = \frac{\text{Usable stock on hand}}{\text{Daily consumption run rate}}$$
$$\text{Reorder Point (ROP)} = (\text{Supplier lead time days} \times \text{Daily demand}) + \text{Safety stock}$$
When $\text{Stock on hand} \le \text{ROP}$, a replenishment order is triggered for:
$$\text{Suggested order quantity} = (\text{Target safety stock} \times 1.5) + (\text{ROP} - \text{Stock on hand})$$
