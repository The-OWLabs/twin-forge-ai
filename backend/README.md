# TwinForge AI — Enterprise Intelligence Backend

The **TwinForge Backend** is a modular, event-driven industrial AI backend designed to provide high-performance physical modeling, predictive analytics, autonomous multi-agent orchestration, and operational copilots for smart manufacturing facilities.

Built following strict **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**, and **SOLID Object-Oriented Principles**, it is completely decoupled from any single frontend or transport layer. It exposes capabilities through **REST/WebSocket APIs**, **gRPC**, and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## SOLID Principles in Practice

- **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: Domain models only encode physical and manufacturing invariants. Persistence, transport, and external ML inference are isolated in dedicated adapters.
- **Open/Closed (OCP)**: New machine archetypes, telemetry sensors, and defect detection algorithms plug in via abstract ports without modifying existing orchestration engines.
- **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Connector implementations (`MqttConnector`, `OpcUaConnector`) and forecasters (`ProphetForecaster`, `TFTForecaster`) satisfy strict behavioral contracts and can be swapped transparently.
- **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Clients depend solely on fine-grained interfaces (e.g. `ITelemetryReader`, `ITrendAnalyzer`) rather than fat monolithic interfaces.
- **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: High-level business logic depends strictly on abstract interfaces. Infrastructure dependencies are injected at runtime via the Dependency Injection container.
