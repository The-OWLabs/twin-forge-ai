# Industrial & Enterprise Connectors (`backend/connectors`)

The **Connectors** module implements secondary adapters that interface with shop-floor Operational Technology (OT) and enterprise Information Technology (IT) systems.

It strictly adheres to **read-only safety guarantees** for shop-floor machinery, ensuring that TwinForge monitors and analyzes equipment without writing unauthorized control commands to programmable logic controllers (PLCs).

## Connector Contracts & Design

Every connector implements the `IOTConnector` or `IITConnector` interface:

- **Lifecycle Management**: Explicit `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `health_check()`, and auto-reconnection with exponential backoff.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Isolates failing network hops to avoid cascading latency.
- **Sparkplug B Decoder**: Parses compressed industrial protocol state messages and converts them into standardized domain telemetry envelopes.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Any telemetry source can feed the domain pipeline interchangeably whether data originates from real OPC UA nodes or a high-resolution simulated replay.
